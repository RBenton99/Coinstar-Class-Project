# Coinstar-Class-Project
This project was an assignment for my CS 231 class, where we learn the basics of C++ coding.
The premise of the assignment was to prompt the user for an amount of coins, and when the amount of each coin was input, the program would give you a total in dollars and cents.
The assignment was just a simple application of the beginning principles, such as understanding some of the types for data, like the INT and FLOAT.
So I started with creating my list of variables, and just listed off the coins that would be part of the counting.
The coins included in the project were as such: pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, and halfdollars.
I gave all of them the INT value so that they could be stored as whole numbers so I would have an accurate count of each coin when doing the calculation.
The "total" variable was given the FLOAT assignment, so that when he calculation was over, the amount of money you had was already converted into the standard form.
The next parts that I had to work on was the input questions and spaces where the user would prompted to enter a value.
This part was simple as it was just assigning input values to the right places for them to be.
So this section of code is just the printed prompt repeated but for each coin mentioned being the only change and the the area where the value would be stored.
The next section of code is the formula for computing the total value of all of the coins, and was formateed into dollars and cents, hence the float type.
The formula would take the input for each coin and muliply iy by its value, so the amount of pennies would be multiplyed by .01 as that it the inherent worth of one penny.
The same structure was repeated of "amount from prompt" multiplyed by the inherent amount, and between each coin section they would be added to a runnning total.
The next section is the text section that prints to the screen a message saying "You have an X amount of Y coins."
This was just to show that the program actually recognized the amount that was input by the user.
The last bit of the program was the outward message that gave the user the total of the coinss input into the prompts.
A simple program to help people ease into learning the C++ language.
